        <u><h2>Introduction</h2></u> <!--Underlines it-->

        <p> <!-- start of paragraph-->
    My name is David Dai. I was born on January 18, 2005. I was born in China. I don't know why my family gave me this name.
    My family consist of my mother, my father, and two little brothers.

        <u><h2>Elementary School</h2></u>

        <p>
    The first elementary school that I went to was Haines. The school was great and I liked it. The amazing thing about that was the fact that a person from that classroom is also in Whitney Young. My first memory was a bad one. I remember being late for school and the teacher yelled at me. For vacation, I went back to China to visit my family and relatives.

        <u><h2> Middle School</h2></u>

        <p>
            For middle school, I went to Healy. That was where I met my most recent friends. I still remember them now. I liked Healy not because the school was good, but because I wanted to see my friends. For vacation, I usually just stayed home the entire summer. Sometimes I would go to a different state and stay there for about a week then come back. There wasn't anything very interesting. That's where Whitney Young came in. I found out that I passed the test and I got into Whitney. I wasn't that happy about saying goodbye to my friends but I didn't want to lose the chance.

        <u><h2> More About Me</h2></u>

        <p>
            
            I would think of myself as 
            
            <ul> <!--list-->
                <li>boring
                <li>sad
                <li>nice
                
                
                
                
            </ul> I'm boring because nothing really happens in my life. I'm not always sad, but most of the time I am. I'm nice because I care about people and I don't try to hurt anybody on purpose. My favorite subject is math. When you do math, most of it is just doing things inside your head. No reading, writing, or moving your body except your hand.
